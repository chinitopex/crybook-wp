#summary Advertising in CryBook
#labels Phase-Deploy,Phase-Design
We doesn't restrict you from adding or using any form of advertisement package you may find in the Internet, but in our singular sidebar we already include a placeholder for you to add your `advertisement code`.

Open `path/to/wordpress/wp-content/themes/crybook/extra/sidebar-page.php` in any text editor and go to line 53:
{{{
<!-- add your advertisement here -->
}}}
Replace the code above with your `advertisement code` mostly in JavaScript.
